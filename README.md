Dojo Mobile Boilerplate
=======================

This is an adaptation of the [dojo boilerplate](https://github.com/csnover/dojo-boilerplate) for mobile applications. 
In particular, unused files are removed from the distribution directory so that it can be directly usable in 
[cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).

build.sh can be used to generate a lightweight build of the application in the dist/ directory. Additionnal modules can 
be added to the application profile by editing profiles/app.profile.js and adding them to the include part of the dojo/dojo layer.
